### Hi there! I'm Rajvi :smiley:

I love to investigate and gain insights from the data as well as develop products.

I have a strong foundation in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Machine Learning. I explore, learn, and implement Data Science concepts to improvise products and solve real-world/business problems using a blend of my technical, analytical, and research skills. In the baseline, I believe - research, execute, analyze, improvise, and repeat and like to showcase my ideas by turning them into products.

Presently, I'm pursuing MS in Software Engineering specialization in Data Science at San Jose State University (SJSU). In my free time, I write about Data Science concepts by breaking complex topics into simple explanations thoroughly. Moreover, I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer.

Technical Skills:- Python & its libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, Keras), SQL, Probability, Statistics, Machine Learning algorithms, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Mining
